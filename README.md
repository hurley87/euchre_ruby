DnD Euchre
===========



The game is played with a Euchre deck(9,10,J,Q,K,A in four suits) + 1 Joker ==> for a total of 25 cards. There are two players (labelled Player 1 and Player 2). To start the game, Player 1 deals each player 11 cards. Following this deal, there is a process (explained below) to determine what is trump. Player with the most tricks wins the round and recieves points.

-------------------
Deal
-------------------

The responsibility for dealing the cards alternates between the players. Suppose that Player 1 deals the first hand. Then Player 2 will deal the second hand, Player 1 the third, and so on. Each player is dealt 11 cards. Of these, there are 5 cards comprising the player’s “hand” plus 3 piles of 2 cards each, termed “table cards.” Of the remaining 3 undealt cards, the top card is turned up. This card is termed the “Decision Card.” At this point, the players begin the process to determine trump.”]

-------------------
Determining Trump
-------------------

Because it is Player 1's deal, Player 2 acts first. Player 2 can decide to either 'pass' or 'order'. If Player 2 orders they are now the 'trump_maker'. Player 1 must pick up the decision card and 'trump' is the decision card's suit.Player 1 inserts thedecision-card in his hand and then chooses a card from his hand to discard. Players now begin to play the cards according to the rules described in the next section. If Player 2 decides to pass, the decision responsibility moves to Player 1.

Player 1 must either pick the card up or turn it down. . If Player 1 picks the Decision Card, they must put it in their base hand and discard one card. At this point Trump is now the decision card's suit and the play of the cards begins according to the rules described below. Player 1’s other choice is to turn down the card. If this choice is made, the decision responsibility moves to Player 2.

At this point, Player 2 can either pass or select a trump suit. If Player 2 selects a trump suit, the play of the cards begins. If Player 2 passes, then Player 1 must choose the trump suit and the play of the cards begins.

The rules above apply except in the case where the Joker is the Decision Card. In that case, must pick up the Joker, discard a card, and declare the trump suit.

At the end this process, two things have happened: we know trump and we know which player made it trump. Both are important to remember.

Trump and Card Value
------------------
When play begins, the players each play one card and the player playing the highest card wins the “trick.” Consequently, it’s important to know which of the two cards is highest. The order of strength of the cards is as follows:

Trump Cards

Joker
Jack of the trump suit (“Right Bower”)
Jack of the suit the same colour as the trump suit (the “Left Bower”)
Ace of the trump suit
King of the trump suit
Queen of the trump suit
10 of the trump suit
9 of the trump suit
Regular Cards
Aces in the 3 non-trump suits
Kings in the 3 non-trump suits
Queens in the 3 non-trump suits
10s in the 3 non-trump suits
9s in the 3 non-trump suits
There are, however, rules about the way the cards must be played that affect the order in this table. This will be described below.

------------------
The Play of the Cards
------------------

After trump has been determined, each player turns up the top card in each of his three piles of table cards. Because Player 1 dealt Player 2 must play a card first (termed “lead”) and then Player 2 plays a card (termed “follower”). The player playing the highest card wins the trick. The following general rules apply to the play of the cards.

Whoever wins a trick, leads on the next trick.

The follower must play a card in the suit lead if he has one. If he does not, he is free to play any other card.

Trump cards always beat regular cards. 

When a Joker is lead, the follower must play their highest trump card. If the follower doesn't have trump, they he can play any other card.
Each time a player plays the top card in his table piles, he must reveal the card underneath.

Players play until all 11 cards are gone. The player with the most tricks wins the trick hand and points according to the rules described in the next section.

------------------
Scoring
------------------

Without loss in generality, I'll assume that Player 1 made it trump.

In total there are 11 tricks. So if Player 1 won 7 tricks, then Player 2 must have won 4 tricks. 

If Player 1 wins more tricks than Player 2, Player 1 receives points in the amount equal to the difference in the number of tricks won by the players. So if Player 1 wins 7 tricks and Player 2 wins 4 tricks, Player 1 gets 7 – 4 = 3 points.

If Player 1 wins fewer tricks than Player 2 (termed a “Euchre”), Player 2 receives the difference in points multiplied by 2. So if Player 1 got 3 tricks and Player 2 got 8 tricks, Player 2 would get 2*(8 – 3) = 10 points.

------------------
Game
------------------

Players alternate dealing. 

The player getting to 100 points first wins the game.
