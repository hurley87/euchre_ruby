euchre_ruby
===========

This is a game my Mom and I made. We have played 2v2 Euchre(the way its traditional) for all life. She grew up playing the game and passed it down to me. 

I'll do my best to explain the rules here: 

Game is played with a Euchre deck + 1 Joker ==> 25 cards. There are two players I'll refer to as player1 and player2. 

-------------------
Deal
-------------------

One player starts by dealing out the cards face down to each player - let's assume player1 deals first.
